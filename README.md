This package implements a simple, configurable permutation on the set of 64-bit
integers.

The permutation is based on a bitmask that maps each bit of the input to a bit
of the output. The bitmask is expanded from a random seed using a [PRNG][1], as
described by *George Marsaglia* in his paper called [Xorshift RNGs][2]. The
permutations are thus believed to be unpredictable, provided provided that the
seed is kept secret.

## Usage

Create a new `Permutation` instance by passing in two parameters:

* The first parameter is the seed, which can be any random value.
* The next paramer is a triplet of integers used by the XORShift to expand the
  seed. Valid values are listed in [George Marsaglia's paper][2], on *page 3*.

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> require 'permutation'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> perm = Permutation.new 42, [13, 7, 17]
=> #<Permutation:â€¦>
irb(main):003:0> perm.map 42
=> 3333656047352411619
irb(main):004:0> perm.unmap 3333656047352411619
=> 42
```

## Use cases

Use cases may vary, but an example that I find useful is generating
[hard][4]-to-guess, random-looking tokens based on IDs stored in a database.
The IDs can be used together with the seed to decode the original ID, but their
[cardinality][5] is the same as that of the IDs themselves. When used smartly,
this can save you from having to index those tokens in the database.
